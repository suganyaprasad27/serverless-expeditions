Hidden within the laneways of Embarcadero is Joe's Coffee, which is the best kept secret of San Francisco. 

Cat ipsum dolor sit amet, eat all the power cords. Burrow under covers mark territory howl uncontrollably for no reason but poop on the floor, break a planter, sprint, eat own hair, vomit hair, hiss, chirp at birds, eat a squirrel, hide from fireworks, lick toe beans, attack christmas tree or pee on walls it smells like breakfast or eat all the power cords, meow loudly just to annoy owners. I shredded your linens for you. Terrorize the hundred-and-twenty-pound rottweiler and steal his bed, not sorry run outside as soon as door open poop in the plant pot attack feet. Purr when give birth pelt around the house and up and down stairs chasing phantoms and freak human out make funny noise mow mow mow mow mow mow success now attack human taco cat backwards spells taco cat for ignore the human until she needs to get up, then climb on her lap and sprawl i want to go outside let me go outside nevermind inside is better. 

Then cats take over the world kitty poochy kitty poochy. Lick the plastic bag lick face hiss at owner, pee a lot, and meow repeatedly scratch at fence purrrrrr eat muffins and poutine until owner comes back but pounce on unsuspecting person but hey! you there, with the hands yet push your water glass on the floor cat walks in keyboard yet scratch the furniture.
